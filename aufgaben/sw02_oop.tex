\subsection{Selfstudy-Questions OOP2}
\subsubsection*{Exercise 4}
\textit{A class is build by three essential components. What are they?}\\
fields, constructor, methods

\subsubsection*{Exercise 5}
\textit{What is the order of the three components?}\\
fields \\
constructor \\
methods

\subsubsection*{Exercise 6}
\textit{What's their purpose?}\\
fields: static variables \\
constructor: initial setting up of an object \\
methods:interaction with the objects of this class

\subsubsection*{Exercise 8}
\textit{What is a variable?}\\
A memory cell in which a value can be stored. 

\subsubsection*{Exercise 9}
\textit{What are the synonyms to instance variables?}\\
fields

\subsubsection*{Exercise 10}
\textit{What do you think where the term instance variable comes from?}\\


\subsubsection*{Exercise 11}
\textit{How can you put comments into a Java-Code?}\\
\verb?/* Block comment */
// Line comment?

\subsubsection*{Exercise 12 (important)}
\textit{With which access-modification do you declare instance variables
	usually? Is it \lstinline{private} or \lstinline{public}? Do you
	have a reason for your answer?}\\
\verb?private? because it is not reachable from outside the object. 

\subsubsection*{Exercise 13}
\textit{Explain the relation between a constructor and the state of an 
	object.}\\
The constructor creates the initial state of an object. 

\subsubsection*{Exercise 14}
\textit{How do we name constructors?}\\
initialization

\subsubsection*{Exercise 15}
\textit{How long are the variables of an object alive (reachable)?}\\
As long as the object is alive. 

\subsubsection*{Exercise 16}
\textit{Why sould you (if possible) initialise instance variables explicit?}\\
To not rely on the default initialisation

\subsubsection*{Exercise 17}
\textit{What's the defualt value which is given to a \lstinline{int} variavle
	by its initialisation?}\\
0

\subsubsection*{Exercise 19}
\textit{What's the use of parameters?}\\
to call a method with a variable

\subsubsection*{Exercise 20}
\textit{What's the difference between a formal and a actual parameter?}\\
a formal parameter is the name of a parameter whereas a actual parameter is its 
value. 

\subsubsection*{Exercise 21}
\textit{Is the following statement correct; "formal parameters are special
	variables"?}\\
yes

\subsubsection*{Exercise 22}
\textit{What's about the accessability of formal parameters?}\\
formal parameters are accessible only from inside the method. 

\subsubsection*{Exercise 23}
\textit{In which way this differs from instance variables?}\\
instance variables are accessible from inside the class. 
\subsubsection*{Exercise 24}
\textit{How do the lifecycles of formal parameters and instance variables 
	differ?}\\
actual parameters are deleted after the method has finished. 

\subsubsection*{Exercise 26}
\textit{How would you translate the expressions "assignment" and 
	"expression"?}\\
Zuweisung \\
Ausdruck

\subsubsection*{Exercise 27}
\textit{How does an assignment-instruction work exactly? What's about to 
	be aware of in relation to data types?}\\
the value from the right side of the \verb?=? is copied to the left side of it. 
\\
both need to be of the same data type.
